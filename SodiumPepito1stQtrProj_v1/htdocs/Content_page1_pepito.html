      <h1>Health Care in the Philippines</h1>
      <hr>
      <img src="../images/context_image1.jpeg">
      <p>The Philippine Health Care System is growing with time. While private hospitals focus on enhancing their devices and services to cure specific diseases, public hospitals prevent and educate the public about different health issues. According to International Trade Administration (2022), “The top three causes of death in the Philippines in 2021 were ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and Covid-19.”. It is basic knowledge to know that private hospitals require a charge. Hence, how do Filipinos suffering from poverty and complicated diseases access safe and quality healthcare? According to the Republic of the Philippines Department of Health (n.d), President Duterte signed the Universal Health Care Bill in 2019, subsequently guaranteeing fair access to on-the-mark and affordable health care goods and services.<p>
